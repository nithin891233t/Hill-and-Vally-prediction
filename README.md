# Hill and Valley Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model using the Logistic Regression method to predict whether a geographical location is a hill or a valley. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of geographical features and can be used in various applications such as geology, agriculture, and urban planning.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/raw/main/Hill%20Valley%20Dataset.csv).

## Project Structure
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded and explored using Pandas.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The features are standardized using `StandardScaler`, and the data is split into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training**: A logistic regression model is used to classify geographical locations as either hills or valleys.
4. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries are used in the project:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` for plotting
- `sklearn` for model building, preprocessing, and evaluation

## Data Overview
The dataset consists of 1212 entries and 101 columns. The features are numerical, and the target variable, `Class`, represents hills (0) and valleys (1).

### Example Data

| V1   | V2   | V3   | ... | V100 | Class |
|------|------|------|-----|------|-------|
| 39.02| 36.49| 38.20| ... | 39.10| 0     |
| 1.83 | 1.71 | 1.77 | ... | 1.69 | 1     |

### Target Distribution
The dataset is balanced, with 606 instances of each class (hill and valley).

## Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python hill_valley_prediction.py
   ```

## Results
The logistic regression model provides the following evaluation metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measure of the model's ability to correctly classify hills and valleys.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions.
- **Classification Report**: Displays precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how logistic regression can be applied to geographical feature data for classification. It provides a foundation for future improvements, such as testing other machine learning algorithms or adding more advanced feature engineering techniques.
